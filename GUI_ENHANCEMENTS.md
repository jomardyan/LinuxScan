# LinuxScan GUI Enhancements

## Overview
The LinuxScan GUI has been significantly enhanced with improved navigation, keyboard shortcuts, and better user experience features.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Keyboard Shortcuts ðŸŽ¯

#### Main Menu Navigation
- **Ctrl+C**: Return to main menu immediately (stops any ongoing processes)
- **Ctrl+Z**: Pause/Resume active scans
- **'m' or 'main' or 'menu' or 'home'**: Quick return to main menu from any input prompt

#### During Scans
- **Ctrl+C**: Stop scan and return to main menu
- **Ctrl+Z**: Pause/Resume scan execution
- All shortcuts work across all scan types and menu contexts

### 2. Improved Navigation Flow ðŸ§­

#### Navigation Breadcrumbs
- Shows current location in the application hierarchy
- Format: `LinuxScan > Quick Scan > Target Configuration`
- Helps users understand where they are in the application

#### Context Retention
- After completing a scan, users are presented with contextual options
- No automatic return to main menu - users choose their next action
- Options include: view results, run another scan, export results, etc.

#### Post-Scan Menus
Every scan now offers these options:
1. **View detailed results** - See comprehensive scan output
2. **Run another scan of the same type** - Quickly repeat the scan
3. **Export results to file** - Save results in various formats
4. **Return to scan menu** - Stay in the current scan context
5. **Return to main menu** - Go back to the main menu
6. **Exit LinuxScan** - Close the application

### 3. Performance Optimizations âš¡

#### System Information Caching
- System info is cached for 30 seconds to improve responsiveness
- Reduces CPU usage during frequent menu navigation
- Automatically refreshes when data becomes stale

#### Faster Navigation
- Reduced delays in menu transitions
- Optimized display rendering
- Enhanced input processing with shortcut detection

#### Improved Progress Indicators
- Better visual feedback during long operations
- Real-time scan status updates
- Clearer indication of scan progress

### 4. Enhanced User Experience ðŸŽ¨

#### Error Recovery
- Graceful error handling with recovery options
- Users can choose to continue, return to main menu, or exit
- System information and dependency checks available in error states

#### Scan History Management
- Enhanced scan history viewer with multiple options
- Export capabilities for historical results

- Ability to run new scans directly from history view

#### Smart Input Handling
- All input prompts now support keyboard shortcuts
- Automatic detection of navigation commands
